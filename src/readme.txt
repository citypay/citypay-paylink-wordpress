to pay to the merchant by reference to some sort of customer or invoice
identifier; the plugin does not at present provide or support -

 * shopping cart functionality;
 * connectivity between any external source of verification of invoice
references, amounts payable thereunder or any external database able
to receive notification of successful and failed payment transactions; and
 * maintenance of any records of payments or payment attempts that can be
accessed from the Wordpress console.

== Installation ==

# Minimum requirements

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater with libcurl support
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* libcurl version 7.10.5 or later with SSL / TLS support

## Creating a page in Wordpress to accept payments

To accept payments using the plugin, it is necessary to create and mark-up
a static page containing the layout, fields, field names and custom error
messages as follows -

    [citypay-payform]
        [citypay-payform-field name="customer-name" type="customer-name" label="Name" order="1"]
        [citypay-payform-field name="email" type="email-address" label="Email Address" order="2"]
        [citypay-payform-field name="identifier" type="identifier" label="Invoice Number" pattern="AAnnnn" order="3" passthrough="true"]
        [citypay-payform-amount-field name="amount" label="Amount" maximum="150.00" minimum="1.00" order="4"]
            [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_EMPTY_STRING"]
                You have specified an empty string (testing "").
            [/error-message]

                You have specified an invalid character.
            [/error-message]
            [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_INVALID_PRECISION"]
                You have put too many digits after the decimal point.
            [/error-message]
            [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_BELOW_MINIMUM_VALUE"]
                You have specified an amount that less than that the practice is able to accept.
            [/error-message]
            [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_ABOVE_MAXIMUM_VALUE"]
                You have specified an amount that more than that the practice is able to accept.
            [/error-message]
        [/citypay-payform-amount-field]
        [citypay-payform-checkbox-field id="accept-terms-and-conditions" name="accept-terms-and-conditions" type="accept-terms-and-conditions" order="5"]
            I accept the "terms and conditions" of payment.
        [/citypay-payform-checkbox-field]
        [citypay-payform-on-page-load]
            You can pay here -
            Please ensure the account number you intend to use is valid.
        [citypay-payform-display submit="Pay this invoice" /]
            Please ensure that you enter the correct amount.
        [/citypay-payform-on-page-load]
        [citypay-payform-on-redirect-success]
            Your payment was successful.
        [/citypay-payform-on-redirect-success]
        [citypay-payform-on-redirect-failure]
            Your payment failed.
        [/citypay-payform-on-redirect-failure]
        [citypay-payform-on-redirect-cancel]
            You cancelled your payment.
        [/citypay-payform-on-redirect-cancel]
        [citypay-payform-on-error]
            A request was submitted to the service provider to effect the
            payment which unfortunately failed. Please contact <a href="...">
            &lt;&gt; for more
            information
        [/citypay-payform-on-error]
    [/citypay-payform]

of the various text-based PayForm fields by reference to the following shortcode
attributes -

`label`: specifies the text to be generated by Wordpress for the relevant
    field.

    `email-address`, `identifier` and `text` representing the type of
    the relevant field, thereby guiding processing.

`id`: specifies the identifier, if any, for the HTML form input field
    generated by Wordpress for the relevant field to enable
    cross-referencing and automation by, for example and only if
    necessary, JavaScript scripts deployed through supplementary
    Wordpress.

    visitor should be passed to the CityPay PayLink hosted payment form
    as a PayLink 'custom parameter' using a hidden field.

### Amount fields

    or more invalid characters such as upper and lower letters (A-Z, and
    a-z respectively), and punctuation such as ',' (commas), '£' (pound
    signs), '$' (dollar signs) and so forth. The only permissible
    characters for an amount value are numeric (0-9) and a single
    period (.) being the decimal point indicating the fractional
    component of an amount.

`CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_INVALID_PRECISION`: the error generated
    if the value submitted to an amount field has been specified, for
    the relevant currency, to an invalid precision. This error typically
    occurs if the fractional component of the amount has been specified
    to more decimal places than expected for the relevant currency.

`CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_BELOW_MINIMUM_VALUE`: the error
    generated if the value submitted to a currency amount-based
    is below the specified minimum value.

`CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_ABOVE_MAXIMUM_VALUE`: the error
    generated if the value submitted to a currency amount-based
    is above the specified maximum value.

`CP_PAYLINK_TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS_NOT_ACCEPTED`: the error generated
    if a checkbox where the `type` is set to `terms-and-conditions`
    is left unchecked on submission of the relevant form.

Example:

    [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_EMPTY_STRING"]
        You have specified an empty string (testing "").
    [/error-message]
    [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_INVALID_CHARACTER"]
        You have specified an invalid character.
    [/error-message]
    [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_INVALID_PRECISION"]
        You have put too many digits after the decimal point.
    [/error-message]
    [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_BELOW_MINIMUM_VALUE"]
        You have specified an amount that less than that the practice is able to accept.
    [/error-message]
    [error-message handle="CP_PAYLINK_AMOUNT_PARSE_ERROR_ABOVE_MAXIMUM_VALUE"]
        You have specified an amount that more than that the practice is able to accept.
    [/error-message]

## Processing test transactions

To test the operation of an e-commerce solution based on WooCommerce in
combination with the CityPay Paylink WooCommerce plugin without processing
transactions that will be settled by the upstream acquirer, the check box
labeled Test Mode appearing on the plugin settings form should be ticked.

## Processing live transactions

To process live transactions for settlement by the upstream acquirer, the
check box labeled Test Mode referenced in the paragraph above must be
unticked.

## Enabling logging

The interaction between WordPress, WooCommerce and the CityPay Paylink
hosted payment form service may be monitored by ticking the check box labeled
Debug Log appearing on the plugin settings form.

Log payment events appearing in the resultant log file will help to trace
any difficulties you may experience accepting payments using the CityPay
Paylink service.

The location of the log file is provided on the plugin settings form.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### WordPress / WooCommerce displays "Sorry, unable to process your order at this time" at the time of checkout

WordPress / WooCommerce displays the generic error "Sorry, unable to process
your order at this time" if is not possible for the application to refer the
customer to the CityPay Paylink hosted payment form.

There may be a variety of reasons that such a referral cannot be made. If
connection failure is persistent, then this may be caused by -

1. incorrect configuration of the merchant identifier (the "MID") or the licence
key used by the plugin to obtain a payment session token from the Paylink
service; or
2. incorrect configuration of the IP address registered with CityPay for
receiving API calls from merchant applications to the CityPay Paylink service
API.

The specific cause of the problem can be determined by enabling debug logging
for the plugin and, after attempting to process a transaction, checking the
debug log.

Configuration of the MID, or the licence key for the installed version of 
WordPress / WooCommerce and the CityPay Paylink plugin is performed through
the WooCommerce settings forms; whereas configuration of the IP address
for the merchant application registered with CityPay is administered by
CityPay. To request configuration of the IP address for the merchant application
please contact <support@citypay.com>.

If the connection failure is not persistent, and intermittent in nature, the
problem is most likely caused by connectivity or DNS name resolution problems
affecting the merchant application generally.

### CityPay Paylink service connectivity issues involving WordPress / WooCommerce implementations

The CityPay Paylink WooCommerce plugin relies upon being able to establish
a secure, encrypted session with the CityPay Paylink service. The OpenSSL
library typically installed with Windows binary versions of PHP is not
accompanied by any certificate authority ("CA") certificates that exist to
certify, through a chain of certificates, the identity of the remote endpoint;
in the present case, the CityPay Paylink service. The problem may affect binary
distributions of PHP for other operating systems as well.

With debug logging enabled in the plugin settings, a problem involving access
to SSL CA certificates may be indicated by a line of the form -

    SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

To resolve this problem, the CA bundle may be downloaded from
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt>,
installed in an appropriate location, and referenced in the php.ini
configuration file for PHP using the curl.cainfo configuration setting.
